## Contributing
Feel free to fork this repository, make some changes, and create a pull request. Your changes will then be reviewed, merged, and deployed once accepted. We encourage you to use different channels than the main ones (#general, #off-topic, #help, and #labs) if your testing could be considered disruptive. We also recommend joining our [Discord](https://discord.gg/KYeTwux) to chat with other developers.
